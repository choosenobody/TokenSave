**I2b overall: IN PROGRESS** (sub-slices I2b.1, I2b.2, I2b.3, I2b.4A, I2b.4S, I2b.4B, I2b.4B-S, I2b.5, I2b.5-S, I2b.6A, I2b.6A-S, I2b.6B, I2b.6B-S, I2b.6C, I2b.6C-S, I2b.6D, I2b.6D-S, I2b.6D-H, I2b.6E complete; I2b.6F plan-only pending)

---

## Active Next Issue

**I2b** — Migrate `index.html` logic into `src/` modules after I2a passes.
See: GitHub Issue #11

**Scope** (structure-preserving refactor only):
- Extract separable logic from `src/main.ts` into `src/` modules
- Preserve all existing behavior (upload, parsing, report, UI)
- Preserve local-only file processing
- Keep Vite build working
- Incremental slices (I2b.1, I2b.2, …)

**Completed I2b sub-slices**: I2b.1 (script migration), I2b.2 (validation), I2b.3 (types), I2b.4A (formatting helpers), I2b.4S (docs refresh), I2b.4B (constants), I2b.4B-S (docs refresh), I2b.5 (parser extraction), I2b.5-S (docs refresh), I2b.6A (predicate/domain helpers), I2b.6A-S (docs refresh), I2b.6B (classifyWaste extraction), I2b.6B-S (docs refresh), I2b.6C (buildFixSuggestion extraction), I2b.6C-S (docs refresh), I2b.6D (normalizeJobs extraction), I2b.6D-S (docs refresh), I2b.6D-H (normalizeJobs utils import hotfix), I2b.6E (data pipeline helpers extraction)

**Next slice**: I2b.6F plan-only analysis. Candidates: parseScheduleMinutes, formatFrequency (pure formatters, no pipeline coupling), buildFixCards (deferred — FIX_LIBRARY coupling), finalizeStat (excluded — calls detectCostRate), analyzeDataset (deferred — top-level orchestrator). detectCostRate remains pricing-sensitive and excluded. Do not start I2b.6F implementation until BG approves plan.

**Forbidden**: No new features, no new pricing model, no diagnose rules D1-D7, no pre-flight rules B1-B3/W1-W5, no backend, no telemetry.

**Recommended slice order** (from original I2b scope): utilities → constants → parsers → domain logic → UI

## Open Issues and Recommended Cleanup Actions

> ⚠️ Do not close or modify issues unless BG explicitly approves. Listed here for reference.

| Issue | Title | Status | Recommended Action |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| #11 | I2b: Migrate index.html logic into src modules | **OPEN** | **Active next issue.** Do not close. |
| #10 | I2a: Vite + TypeScript scaffold | **OPEN** | **Completed by PR #14.** Recommend: close. |
| #9 | I1.1: Harden .gitignore and add process docs | **OPEN** | **Completed by PR #13.** Duplicate of #12 (both superseded by #13). |
| #8 | I2: Vite + TypeScript scaffold | **OPEN** | **Parent of I2a.** Recommend: close as completed by #10 and #11 (I2a done, I2b active). |
| #7 | I8: README, MVP_SPEC, PRIVACY, SECURITY, RULES docs | OPEN | Future issue. Not yet started. |
| #6 | I7: No-network test and evidence bundle system | OPEN | Future issue. Not yet started. |
| #5 | I6: Rule engine — Pre-flight rules B1-B3 and W1-W5 | OPEN | Future issue. Forbidden until I2b complete. |
| #4 | I5: Rule engine — Diagnose rules D1-D7 | OPEN | Future issue. Forbidden until I2b complete. |
| #3 | I4: Domain layer — pricing data and cost calculation | OPEN | Future issue. Forbidden until I2b complete. |
| #2 | I3: Add parser modules with tests | OPEN | Future issue. Forbidden until I2b complete. |
| #1 | I1: Remove tracked node_modules and add .gitignore | CLOSED | Done. |

## Protected Product Constraints

These constraints are **never negotiable** regardless of issue scope:

- **Local-first**: files never leave the device
- **No backend**: zero server-side components
- **No telemetry, analytics, tracking**: zero external data egress
- **No fetch/XMLHttpRequest/sendBeacon**: zero network calls from the app
- **No external LLM calls**: app never calls any LLM API
- **No auto-apply**: fix hints are CLI text only, never executed
- **No runtime write-path**: app does not write any files
- **No API key collection**: zero credential handling
- **node_modules/ in .gitignore**: never commit node_modules
- **No secrets in repo**: zero credentials or tokens in source
- **Unknown model pricing defaults to highest reasonable rate**: never cheap

---

**Recommended Next Step**: BG approves I2b.6F plan scope. Candidates: parseScheduleMinutes + formatFrequency (standalone pure formatters, no data-pipeline coupling, no pricing coupling). buildFixCards deferred until FIX_LIBRARY analysis. finalizeStat excluded. analyzeDataset deferred. Each slice must be PR'd and reviewed independently.

Current completed slices (I2b.1–I2b.5, I2b.6A, I2b.6A-S, I2b.6B, I2b.6B-S, I2b.6C, I2b.6C-S, I2b.6D, I2b.6D-S, I2b.6D-H, I2b.6E) extracted: inline script, validation, types, formatting helpers, constants, parser, predicate helpers, classifyWaste, buildFixSuggestion, normalizeJobs, normalizeJobs utils import fix, data pipeline helpers (createJobStat / ensureSyntheticStat / resolveJob / applyRunRecord).

detectCostRate remains sensitive and must not be changed without explicit pricing-slice approval.

Each slice must be PR'd and reviewed independently. Rollback = `git revert <merge-commit>`.

## Implementation Agent Assignment (I2b)

| Role | Agent |
|------|-------|
| Implementer | `coding_cat` |
| Reviewer | `guardian_cat` |

**Workflow**: Path B — coding_cat produces patch/diff → Hermes applies to controlled branch → guardian_cat reviews → BG approves → merge.
